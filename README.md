This repository supports modelling work on viral load dynamics in patients with symptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infections, as reported in this report: [Modelling upper respiratory viral load dynamics of SARS-CoV-2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.21256182) by Challenger et al.

Upon publication, the data used in this study ('CombinedDataset.xlsx') will be made available in the Supplementary Materials. These scripts can then be used to generate the figures in the article.
