# Viral_Load_Covid19
This repository supports modelling work on viral load dynamics in patients with symptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infections, as reported in this publication in BMC Medicine: [Modelling upper respiratory viral load dynamics of SARS-CoV-2](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-021-02220-0) by JD Challenger, CY Foo, Y Wu, AWC Yan, M. Moradi Marjaneh, F Liew, RS Thwaites, LC Okell, AJ Cunnington.

The data used in this study ('CombinedDataset.xlsx') is now available here. These scripts can be used to generate the figures in the article.

Please begin by running the script 'load_dataset.R', which will load and pre-process the data, so it can be used in other scripts.
