# Viral_Load_Covid19
This repository supports modelling work on viral load dynamics in patients with symptomatic SARS-Cov-2 infections, as reported in this report: [Modelling upper respiratory viral load dynamics of SARS-CoV-2](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.01.21256182) by Challenger et al.

As modelling tools are developed, they will be made freely available in this repository.
